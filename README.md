# etch-a-sketch

## Project Description   

This is based off the popular real life etch-a-sketch drawing board, as a pixel sketch pad to be drawn on using various pens and tools, made as part of the open source web development course [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).  This is the fourth assignment of the foundations section. 

Find the live preview [here](https://kaglet.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).

At full screen the tool should look like this:

## To add in future if I revisit

- Mobile responsiveness.
